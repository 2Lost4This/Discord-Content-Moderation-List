## What is the "Content Moderation" tool?

AutoMod is here to take some of the load off your shoulders, working to keep your community and conversations clean around the clock so you can take time to enjoy yourself without stressing about what's happening when you're out and about. As your one-stop-shop for content moderation filters, AutoMod lives under the Content Moderation tab within your Community-enabled Server Settings. 

At launch, AutoMod comes equipped with keyword filters that can automatically detect, block, and alert you of messages containing harmful words or phrases before they're ever posted in your #text-channels, Threads, and inside your Text Chat in Voice. You can even have users who try to post harmful words or phrases be Timed Out automatically, so they won’t be able to continue posting until you’re back.

## What is this repo for?
I had had trouble finding certain words to put on the list during and after the release. Therefore, I wanted to create a place where you can find many useful folders and files with words that you can use.  Here we try to keep all lists completely up to date to keep your community safe.
